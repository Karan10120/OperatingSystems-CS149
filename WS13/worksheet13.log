    1  rsync -arv filedir/ filedir1/
    2  cp -r filedir/ filedir2/
    3  ls -latr filedir1/
    4  ls -latr filedir2/
                            In filedir1, I noticed that the modification date and the file permissions
                            remained the same as the original filedir. However, in filedir2 since cp was used
                            the file permissions had changes to them as well as time stamps. So rsync had
                            synchronized the contents of the directory, while cp has just made a copy.
    5  cd filedir1
    7  stat zap.c 
    8  mkdir textDir
   10  rmdir textDir/
   13  find . -name zap.c
   14  df
   15  du -sh .
   17  history > worksheet13.log
